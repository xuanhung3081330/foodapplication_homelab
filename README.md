# foodapplication_homelab
A simple food ordering API written in Go.  
Currently paused, as I’m focusing on learning more Linux/OS internals.  
I’ll resume development later.

## Purpose
This project was created as a way to learn Go.  
It’s nothing serious — just a playground backend API that I use for deploying to my bare-metal k3s cluster.
