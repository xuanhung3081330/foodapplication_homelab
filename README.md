# foodapplication_homelab
A simple food ordering api written in GoLang.
Currently, I have stopped implementing this project as there are some Linux/OS knowledge that I want to delve into. Will get back to this soon

## Purpose
This project was created for me to learn GoLang. Nothing serious. Just a playground that provides me a simple backend API that I use to deploy to my bare-metal k3s cluster.
